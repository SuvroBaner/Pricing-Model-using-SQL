Time duration weighted average price for each product.
I want to calculate the time duration weighted average price for each product id for that day.

e.g. Average Price for PA1 = (100*4 + 105*4 + 110*8 + 115*4) / 20
i.e Here price stays 100 for 4 hrs, 105 for 4 hrs, 110 for 8 hrs and 115 for 4 hrs (the closing time is midnight)
